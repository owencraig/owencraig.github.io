On the third day of the AngularU conference in San Francisco my colleage Aaron Starkston [@astarkston](http://twitter.com/astarkston) and I attended a workshop with Andrew Connell [@andrewconnell](http://www.twitter.com/andrewconnell) on working with O365 and Azure straight from Sngular written SPAs. Aaron has put together an overview for Rightpoint's blog.
<blockquote>
  ...Now for the fun stuff- combining Angular + O365 development. The remaining part of the workshop walks through how to set up the connection between a SPA and O365. There are so many things you can do working with <a href="https://github.com/officedev">O365 development</a>, and a lot of that can be handled with the REST API.
