I've spent the last 3 days in San Francisco at AngularU larning about some of the new cool stuff going on i that space. Since work paid for me to go, I've put together a post on their blog with an overview of day 2. There's some _seriously_ cool stuff going on, I'm hoping to dive deeper into these in the near future.

  ...Straight out of the gate we had the opportunity to hear from Jonathan Turner (developer at Microsoft on the Typescript team) more about <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a> and I've got to say... it's awesome.

  For starters it allows us to use, well... types. If you're someone who's not a big fan of static languages, so you don't want to have to write the type name 4 times just to use it. I get it, you don't have to, what it gives you is some development time checking for objects and parameters so you don't have the instances where you're passing in '1' instead of 1 and it blowing up. It also gives you the ability to use as much or as little of the type system you want.
